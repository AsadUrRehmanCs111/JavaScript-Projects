# Hi :wave: Beatiful Developers!

Today I create a new web application with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).
This is JavaScript Beginner Weather App.

To do build this app, You must know the basics in JavaScript and HTML, like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc

The only difficulty you might face, is how to work with an API using JavaScript? Just go and learn it'sfrom [The Coding Train
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecT42O6I_WI). Trust me it's Not a big problem 

## :sparkles:Features:

1. You just have to Enter your city Name.
2. It will show the entered City and Country (like Lahore, Pakistan).
3. It will Show the Current Day with Date (like wednesday January 6,2021).
4. It will show the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit,
5. The weather description (clear sky, Rain etc...),
